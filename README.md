## LLM Integration Examples

### Keyword Extraction Workflow
The LLM should follow this pattern when using the MCP server:

1. **Analyze client problem** ‚Üí Extract legal keywords
2. **Call search_cases_by_problem** ‚Üí With extracted keywords
3. **Review results** ‚Üí Call get_case_details for promising cases
4. **Expand research** ‚Üí Use find_similar_precedents for related cases

### Example Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Defective Product Warranty
**Client Problem**: "I bought a laptop that stopped working after 3 months. The manufacturer won't honor the warranty and claims it's user damage, but I never dropped it."

**LLM Analysis**: Extract keywords ‚Üí `["breach of warranty", "defective product", "consumer protection", "merchantability"]`

**MCP Call**:
```javascript
{
  "tool": "search_cases_by_problem",
  "arguments": {
    "search_keywords": ["breach of warranty", "defective product", "consumer protection", "merchantability"],
    "problem_summary": "Laptop failed after 3 months, manufacturer denying warranty coverage",
    "case_type": "warranty",
    "date_range": "recent-2years",
    "jurisdiction": "new-york"
  }
}
```

#### Scenario 2: Landlord-Tenant Dispute
**Client Problem**: "My landlord is trying to evict me for non-payment but I've been withholding rent because of mold issues they refuse to fix."

**LLM Analysis**: Extract keywords ‚Üí `["rent withholding", "habitability", "landlord tenant", "mold", "eviction defense"]`

**MCP Call**:
```javascript
{
  "tool": "search_cases_by_problem",
  "arguments": {
    "search_keywords": ["rent withholding", "habitability", "landlord tenant", "mold", "eviction defense"],
    "problem_summary": "Tenant withholding rent due to mold, facing eviction",
    "case_type": "landlord-tenant",
    "jurisdiction": "california"

```

### Keyword Extraction Guidelines
- **3-7 keywords** optimal for balanced precision/recall
- **Use legal terminology** when possible (e.g., "merchantability" vs "quality")
- **Include case type indicators** (warranty, contract, etc.)
- **Add procedural terms** if relevant (dismissal, summary judgment, etc.)
- **Combine specific and general terms** for comprehensive coverage

### Date Range
- Focus on cases from the last 10 years for current precedents
- Use `date_filed_after` parameter with date 10 years ago

### Amount Filters
- Cases with controversy amount under $10,000
- Small claims jurisdiction cases

### Court Identifiers
When using the `court` parameter, prioritize:
- `ny-civ-ct` - NYC Civil Court
- `ny-dist-ct-nassau` - Nassau District Court
- `ny-dist-ct-suffolk` - Suffolk District Court
- `ny-city-ct-*` - Various city courts
