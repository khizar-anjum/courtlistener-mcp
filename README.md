- Partial matches and common abbreviations are supported
- Multiple courts can be specified with comma separation

## LLM Integration Examples

### Keyword Extraction Workflow
The LLM should follow this pattern when using the MCP server:

1. **Analyze client problem** ‚Üí Extract legal keywords
2. **Call search_cases_by_problem** ‚Üí With extracted keywords
3. **Review results** ‚Üí Call get_case_details for promising cases
4. **Expand research** ‚Üí Use find_similar_precedents for related cases

### Example Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Defective Product Warranty
**Client Problem**: "I bought a laptop that stopped working after 3 months. The manufacturer won't honor the warranty and claims it's user damage, but I never dropped it."

**LLM Analysis**: Extract keywords ‚Üí `["breach of warranty", "defective product", "consumer protection", "merchantability"]`

**MCP Call**:
```javascript
{
  "tool": "search_cases_by_problem",
  "arguments": {
    "search_keywords": ["breach of warranty", "defective product", "consumer protection", "merchantability"],
    "problem_summary": "Laptop failed after 3 months, manufacturer denying warranty coverage",
    "case_type": "warranty",
    "date_range": "recent-2years",
    "jurisdiction": "california" // Can also use "all", "federal", "ca", "scotus", etc.
  }
}
```

#### Additional Jurisdiction Examples:
```javascript
// Search all courts nationwide
{ "jurisdiction": "all" }

// Search only federal courts  
{ "jurisdiction": "federal" }

// Search specific court
{ "jurisdiction": "scotus" }

// Search multiple specific courts
{ "jurisdiction": "ca9,scotus,cal" }

// Search all Texas courts
{ "jurisdiction": "texas" }
```

#### Scenario 2: Landlord-Tenant Dispute
**Client Problem**: "My landlord is trying to evict me for non-payment but I've been withholding rent because of mold issues they refuse to fix."

**LLM Analysis**: Extract keywords ‚Üí `["rent withholding", "habitability", "landlord tenant", "mold", "eviction defense"]`

**MCP Call**:
```javascript
{
  "tool": "search_cases_by_problem",
  "arguments": {
    "search_keywords": ["rent withholding", "habitability", "landlord tenant", "mold", "eviction defense"],
    "problem_summary": "Tenant withholding rent due to mold, facing eviction",
    "case_type": "landlord-tenant",
    "jurisdiction": "texas"  // Or any state where the issue occurred
  }
}
```

#### Scenario 3: Employment Discrimination
**Client Problem**: "I was passed over for promotion three times despite excellent reviews. Younger, less experienced colleagues were promoted instead."

**MCP Call**:
```javascript
{
  "tool": "search_cases_by_problem",
  "arguments": {
    "search_keywords": ["age discrimination", "promotion denial", "disparate treatment", "ADEA"],
    "case_type": "employment",
    "jurisdiction": "federal"  // Federal courts for discrimination cases
  }
}
```

### Keyword Extraction Guidelines
- **3-7 keywords** optimal for balanced precision/recall
- **Use legal terminology** when possible (e.g., "merchantability" vs "quality")
- **Include case type indicators** (warranty, contract, etc.)
- **Add procedural terms** if relevant (dismissal, summary judgment, etc.)
- **Combine specific and general terms** for comprehensive coverage

### Best Practices

#### Date Range Selection
- **Recent precedents**: Use `recent-2years` for current legal trends
- **Established law**: Use `established-precedent` for well-settled principles
- **Comprehensive search**: Use `all-time` for historical perspective

#### Jurisdiction Selection
- **Start broad**: Begin with state or federal level searches
- **Narrow down**: Use specific court IDs for targeted research
- **Cross-jurisdictional**: Use `"all"` for nationwide precedent searches

#### Procedural Requirements
When searching for procedural rules:
```javascript
{
  "tool": "get_procedural_requirements",
  "arguments": {
    "case_type": "breach of contract",
    "jurisdiction": "florida",  // Specify the relevant jurisdiction
    "claim_amount": 25000  // Optional: helps determine court level
  }
}
```
